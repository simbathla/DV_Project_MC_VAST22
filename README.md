# DV_Project_MC_VAST22

In this project we implement 6 different visualizations to answer the three questions asked in the VAST 2022 challenge with respect to the economic aspect of the city of Engagement, Ohio. By applying essential data visualization design principles, the interface allows the user to explore the data in an intuitive way. Through these six visualizations we try to gauge the economic conditions of the participants, who are the residents of the city, the pubs and restaurants in the area, and the employers in the city.
